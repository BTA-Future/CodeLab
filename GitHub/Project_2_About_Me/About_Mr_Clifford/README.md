# Summary

Hello World! I am Mr. Clifford. I am a Computer Science teacher at Brockton High School. I am also the Web Content Manager for [Brockton Public Schools](https://www.bpsma.org).

Outside of work, I love to learn expand my knowledge of programming. I took the [Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/blockchain-developer-nanodegree--nd1309) course and earned my [certificate](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/QV6SJ4G5). I also love to workout. I try to make it to the gym 5 times a week. The gym is a healthy way for me to relieve stress. My favorite sport is soccer and my favorite team is [Manchester United](https://www.manutd.com/). But of course, I love my New England Teams ([Patriots](https://www.patriots.com/), [Red Sox](https://www.mlb.com/redsox), and [Bruins](https://www.nhl.com/bruins)).

...and I love Pixar!

# Family

Family is very imporant to me. My parents worked hard their whole life to make sure my brothers and I had a good life. I have two brothers, one older and one younger (yes, that makes me the middle child). We have lived all over Brockton, MA.

Like I said, my parents are so hard working. My dad was a Marine and a Police Officer and my mom is an Emergency Room Nurse. My older brother lives in Berkeley, CA and is a developer. My younger brother works at East Middle School.
