# About

This is a formula for my favorite type of workout. To do this workout you choose two muscle groups (one **big** and one *small*) and choose appropriate exercises for each section.

> Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.
