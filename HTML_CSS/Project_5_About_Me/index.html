    <h1>Summary</h1>
    
    <p>Hello World! I am Mr. Clifford. I am a Computer Science teacher at Brockton High School. I am also the Web Content Manager for <a href="https://www.bpsma.org">Brockton Public Schools</a>.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I love to learn expand my knowledge of programming. I took the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/blockchain-developer-nanodegree--nd1309">Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree</a> course and earned my <a href="https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/QV6SJ4G5">certificate</a>. I also love to workout. I try to make it to the gym 5 times a week. The gym is a healthy way for me to relieve stress. My favorite sport is soccer and my favorite team is <a href="https://www.manutd.com/">Manchester United</a>. But of course, I love my New England Teams (<a href="https://www.patriots.com/">Patriots</a>, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/redsox">Red Sox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nhl.com/bruins">Bruins</a>.</p>
    <p>...and I love Pixar!</p>
    
    <h1>Family</h1>
    
    <p>Family is very imporant to me. My parents worked hard their whole life to make sure my brothers and I had a good life. I have two brothers, one older and one younger (yes, that makes me the middle child). We have lived all over Brockton, MA.</p>
    <p>Like I said, my parents are so hard working. My dad was a Marine and a Police Officer and my mom is an Emergency Room Nurse. My older brother lives in Berkeley, CA and is a developer. My younger brother works at East Middle School.</p>
