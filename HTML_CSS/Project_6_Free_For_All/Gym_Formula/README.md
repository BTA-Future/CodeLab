# About

This is a formula for my favorite type of workout. To do this workout you choose two muscle groups (one **big** and one *small*) and choose appropriate exercises for each section.

> Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.

# Terminology

1. Rep: The number of times you perform an exercise
2. Set: The number of cycles of reps that you complete
3. Superset: Alternating sets of two different exercises with no rest in between

# Plans For Future Development

In the future, I would like to add more exercises, add a full sample workout routine, and add different workout formulas. In addition, I would like to add videos of each exercise or links to descriptions. In the far future I would like people to video tape themselves completing exercises and use image recognition software, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to analyze user's form completing exercises and offer suggestions for improvement.
