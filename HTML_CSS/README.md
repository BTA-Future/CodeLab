# About

> HTML is the universal markup language for the Web. HTML lets you format text, add graphics, create links, input forms, frames, and tables, etc., and save it all in a text file that any browser can read and display. [HTML Summary](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_summary.asp)

> CSS gives you total control of the layout, without messing up the document content. [HTML Summary](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_summary.asp)

We will be using HTML to improve our current GitHub projects. We will be transferring our README.md files into HTML webpages. CSS will help you add style to these pages.

# Vocabulary

1. **HTML**: **H**yper-**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage, the language used to define the logical structure of web pages, breaking them down into various elements and tags. [Source](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/vocabulary.html)
2. **Element**: A logical unit of an HTML document, such as a header, a paragraph, or a link. Every element begins with an opening tag; most also include content and a closing tag. [Source](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/vocabulary.html)
3. **Opening Tag**: A unit of HTML code, enclosed in angle brackets, that marks the beginning of an element. Examples include `<h2>`, `<p>`, and `<a>`. Some opening tags, such as `<img>` and `<br>`, are self-contained elements that have no content or closing tag. [Source](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/vocabulary.html)
4. **Closing Tag**: A unit of HTML code that marks the end of an element, such as `</h2>`, `</p>`, and `</a>`. Each closing tag is the same as the corresponding opening tag, except for an additional slash after the first angle bracket and the omission of any attributes. [Source](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/vocabulary.html)
5. **Content**: Everything between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element. The content can consist of text and/or nested HTML elements. [Source](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/vocabulary.html)
6. **Attribute**: A property or characteristic of an HTML element, such as id or src or style or onclick, that is specified inside its opening tag using the syntax `attributename="value"`. Attribute values should be enclosed in quotes (though browsers don't always enforce this rule), and multiple attribute assignments are separated by spaces. The order in which multiple attributes are specified doesn't matter. [Source](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/vocabulary.html)
7. **CSS**: **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets, the language used to specify the appearance (e.g., fonts, colors, borders, and placement) of HTML elements. CSS code can be placed in an external .css file or inside the special HTML `<style>` element, but for simple web pages it is easiest to assign it using the style attribute. [Source](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/vocabulary.html)
8. **Property**: Any characteristic of the appearance or placement of an HTML element that can be specified using CSS, such as `color` or `font-family` or `margin`. The syntax for specifying a property is `property-name:value;` (note the colon before the value, the semicolon after it, and the absence of quotes). The order in which multiple properties are specified doesn't matter. [Source](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/vocabulary.html)
9. **World Wide Web (WWW)**: An information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). [Source](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro)
10. **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**: Any identifier used to identify a resource by location, name, or both. [Source 1](https://www.keycdn.com/support/comparing-uri-vs-url) [Source 2](https://dev.to/flippedcoding/what-is-the-difference-between-a-uri-and-a-url-4455)
11. **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**: A subset of URI used to locate a resource. [Source 1](https://www.keycdn.com/support/comparing-uri-vs-url) [Source 2](https://dev.to/flippedcoding/what-is-the-difference-between-a-uri-and-a-url-4455)
10. **Internet**: The global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)
11. **ID**: Specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document).[Source](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp)
12. **Class**: Used to define equal styles for elements with the same class name. [Source](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp)
13. **Relative Path**: A URL that only contains a portion of the full path. Its complete location is based on its relation to the directory to which it is linking. [Source](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/relapath.htm)
14. **Absolute Path**: Contains the root directory and all other subdirectories in which a file or folder is contained. [Source](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/absopath.htm)
15. **Comment**: A programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming))
